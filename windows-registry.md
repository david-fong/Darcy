Not related, but written here in case I forget what I did:
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\NoUninstallFromStart
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CredUI\DisablePasswordReveal
right-click recycle bin and check the "prompt before moving to recycle-bin" box
random note: can open control panel with windows + pause/break
don't turn on "lower screen brightness in battery saving mode".
  seems to lock screen brightness until next computer restart.
settings > system > multitasking > don't show snap beside options.
settings > system > power&sleep  > always network disconnect on sleep.
Search up how to "force" uninstall things like Microsoft Solitaire Collection.
