Not related, but written here in case I forget what I did:
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\NoUninstallFromStart
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CredUI\DisablePasswordReveal
right-click recycle bin and check the "prompt before moving to recycle-bin" box

random note: can open control panel with windows + pause/break

settings > system > multitasking > don't show snap beside options.
