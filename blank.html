        <div>I suggest that you give that issue ticket a thumbs up to show support for it. You can also subscribe to it to get notified about discussion and progress. Please avoid making noisy comments there like ones that just consist of "+1" / "bump".</div>
        <div>If anyone reading this ends up raising an issue ticket like I suggested, please either comment here with the link to it, or notify me in it with "@starball5" and a link to this Stack Overflow post so I can update it.</div>
        <div>now that you've done that, the feature request needs to get enough community support to be added to the backlog. this is time sensitive. there's a 60 day window to get 20 thumbs up reactions on the issue ticket. I'd suggest sharing this issue ticket with your developer friends / colleagues and asking them to give it a thumbs up if they would also like to see this implemented. sharing on [r/vscode](https://reddit.com/r/vscode) is also an option.</div>
        <div>People, please stop making comments that just consist of "+1" and similar. Read the rules in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Submitting-Bugs-and-Suggestions. If you want to say "+1", give the first comment in this issue ticket a thumbs up. _That's_ what the maintainers look at to guide what they prioritize. You writing "+1" comments just spams the inboxes of people who want to get pings about actual meaningful discussion or progress related to the issue.</div>
