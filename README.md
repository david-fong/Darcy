# myScripts

Mostly run configuration scripts. If you would like to use this, you should clone and copy this repo to the directory specified by the environment variable "XGD\_CONFIG\_HOME", which by default should be "~/.config/". If XGD\_CONFIG\_HOME does not exist, set it to whatever you'd like (the default is recommended). You should source /git/bashrc in your ~/.bash\_profile file. You can put a gitconfig-style file in /git/config\_\_local containing your name and email. Similarly, you can put machine-local bash run-config comands in /bash/aliases\_\_local.
